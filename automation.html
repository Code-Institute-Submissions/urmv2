					<h1 class="text-center"><u>Automation, Gender and Securitization</u></h1>
					<br>
					<h3 class="text-center">To what extent is the state the main focus of security policies?</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						In this question, we consider the extent that the state is focused upon through security
						policies. In the contemporary age of globalisation - an increase in capabilities that concur
						with technological development abetting the movement of people and goods and services, entwined
						with a globalised market that is built upon Western-liberal principles of free market
						competition - the focus towards the state as a security object has become limited.
					</p>
					<p>
						The recent development of policies by international governmental organisations (IGOs),
						legitimised by state-backed support, highlight the phenomenon of state security as asymmetrical
						to non-state security concerns associated with individuals and numerous external factors
						relating to globalisation. The intensity of these concerns is indicative by the European Union’s
						implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 and numerous climate
						change conventions facilitated by The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
						(UNFCCC) since 1992. Both GDPR and the actions of UNFCCC promote the need for regional or global
						interstate cooperation to create policies that overcome future issues connected to technological
						development.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following this trend, the focus of this essay will explore the effects that automation could
						have on global society and, thus, the security policies that may need to be implemented by
						state-policymakers, IGOs and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and transnational
						corporations (TNCs). It will consider automation as posing a threat to the security of the
						societal and economic sectors (in the form of domestic and international inequality,
						monopolisation, and individual well-being). This will be explored predominantly by the logic of
						Securitization as put forward by Buzan et al. (1998), and the application of a ‘gendered-lens’
						analysis (The Open University, 2020b).
					</p>
					<p>
						Both approaches look towards the potential effects of automation over the next few decades and
						the issues this presents. Securitization allows for reflection towards the range of narratives
						and variety of actors that may prohibit or inhibit successful automation, while providing a
						framework of analysis that allows for study towards certain sectors within the international
						realm: societal and economic. We limit ourselves to focusing on these two sectors primarily, as
						they are presented with the most notable prudent security concerns vis-à-vis automation. A
						‘gendered-lens’ is included to analyse the varying structural dis/advantages that individuals
						have as a cause of their very existence and the environment they are nurtured within. Thus, the
						utilisation of these approaches allows for both quantitative and qualitative evidence to support
						the claim that automation is likely to create security concerns that transcend the state level.
					</p>
					<p>
						This essay will first explore the tenets of Securitization and ‘gendered-lens’ approaches to
						convey our methodological basis. It will then analyse reports from academics, IGOs, NGOs and
						governments towards the future of automation to gain the perception of what issues are prevalent
						and how this will affect the processes of policy creation and their efficacy. The focus towards
						different actors and their varied presentations or arguments towards automation and the
						consequential security concerns, leads us to our central argument and possible solutions: for
						successful automation to be implemented, policy must ensure that the economic security of the
						individual is preserved. For this to be provident, increased taxation, stringent regulations
						that diminish the monopolisation of the technology sector, and accessible educational programmes
						incorporating at least one of the Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) disciplines
						need to be implemented on a transnational level.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Securitisation:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						Securitization is the process of attending to an issue externally to the norms of the
						conventional political realm (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 23). For an issue to become securitized, a
						discursive process must occur between an actor and their audience, ultimately shaping
						public-legitimisation towards the use of extraordinary measures in attending to said issue. This
						requires four components:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A referent object: the thing that is threatened – this could be a physical entity, such as
							the state, or an abstract concept, such as cultural values. </li>
						<li>The existential threat: the issue that, without the use of extraordinary measures, will
							devastate the referent object.</li>
						<li>The performative speech act: the discourse shaped between an actor and their relevant
							audience to convince them that extraordinary measures are warranted. Thus, leading to the
							audience’s support towards the use of extraordinary measures.</li>
						<li>Extraordinary measures: these are the acts that take place to ensure the preservation of the
							referent object.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="float-right">
						(Open University, 2020a).
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>
						The simplest example of securitization in action can be attributed to the discourse presented
						(the performative speech act) and the actions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
						and the UNFCCC in presenting the ozone layer as the referent object against the existential
						threat posed by chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions in productive processes. This warranted the
						extraordinary measure to ban their use in production via the Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987
						(Greene, 1997, p. 327). This was effective due to amassing support from global society,
						legitimising the actions of policymakers imposing regulatory measures on TNCs. Notably, this is
						an example of successful interstate cooperation attending to a transnational security issue.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Buzan et al. (1998), Security: A New Framework for Analysis the securitizing process is
						analysed across five sectors: military, environmental, economic, societal, and political.
						Though, this does not mean they do not overlap. In many cases, successful securitization
						requires the overlapping of sectors, and the participation of their relevant actors, to both
						shape the performative speech act and manifest the extraordinary measures needed to attend to
						the security threat – these are ‘heterogeneous security complexes’ (Buzan et al., 1998, pp.
						16-17). For the purposes of this essay we will focus on the economic and societal sectors.
					</p>
					<p>
						As these are the two sectors most likely to be affected by automation. The final aspect of
						securitization that will be utilised is the emphasis towards the different levels that issues
						effect: local, regional, and global. This is key to analysing automation through the logic of
						securitization, as it is inherently a global issue, requiring extraordinary measures being
						enacted upon through interstate cooperation. The regional level will serve as the most effective
						route to securitising automation, as will be seen through the example from policies of the
						Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Thus, we argue the state is not the foci of
						security policy relating to automation.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Gendered Lens:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						The term ‘gendered lens’ is a product of feminist interpretations of international relations
						scholarship (IR). In the classical sense of feminist IR studies, such as Cynthia Enloe’s seminal
						work Bananas, Beaches and Bases (1989, pp. 200-201), the role of women (and men) in
						international politics has been a necessary approach in shaping frameworks that focus on their
						roles and the values that are expected within societies, and their differing nature. By the term
						‘gendered lens’, it highlights the distinct gendered expectations and inherent inequalities that
						lead to security concerns towards the individual (The Open University, 2020b).
					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore, a gendered lens provides both quantitative and qualitative evidence towards inherent
						societal biases, opportunities and incentives available to both sexes, and the likeliness of
						their roles becoming automated. While conveying the nature of automation as having a greater
						effect on individual security than the state, requiring unique policy decisions to overcome
						gender-related issues. Examples will include data on women’s participation in STEM educational
						programmes and the technology sector, and the effects that automation may have on the gendered
						dynamics of the future labour-force.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>“Thou aimest high”; Automation and the future of the labour-force:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						Automation, the advancement of robotic technology and artificial intelligence (AI) that
						surpasses human capabilities to perform tasks (MGI, 2017a, p. 1), is being heralded as the
						fourth industrial revolution (Calvão and Thara, 2019, p. 2). Following revolutions from the
						nineteenth-century attributed to: the steam engine; electrification; and microelectronics
						(Thomas, 2020). These former revolutions transformed the nature of work for the individual and
						had significant economic benefits for the states that had the capabilities to implement the use
						of new technologies (IOE, 2017, p. 6).
					</p>
					<p>
						Achieving these benefits required gradual changes in policy and the development of social
						programmes and infrastructure, providing a safety net for the individual through welfare
						systems, labour regulations and mandatory, state-funded education (MGI, 2017b, pp. 46-47)
						Ultimately leading to a duality of benefits for the state and their citizens: the state could
						effectively compete within an increasingly globalized economy vis-à-vis the improvement of
						working conditions and increased productivity, and incentivising the upskilling of their
						labour-force (Frey and Osborne, 2013, p. 12).
					</p>
					<p>
						The stark difference between these revolutions and automation is the transformation of tasks
						that were routine, and easily mechanised, while still requiring the cognitive skills of humans
						(MGI, 2017a, p. 1). Recent developments in AI have led to greater cognitive abilities and
						accuracy than humans, such as can be seen with lip reading (MGI, 2017a, p. 3), and driverless
						cars, which was seen as an unachievable feature of robotics in 2004 (Frey and Osborne, 2013, p.
						4). This highlights the exponential ability for machines to learn across short spans of time.
						The impact of AI and technological innovation is ‘ten times higher and at 300 times the scale or
						roughly 3000 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution’ (McKinsey Global Institute in IOE,
						2017, p. 11). Thus, we are entering unknown territory for the future of the labour-force, with
						potentially catastrophic consequences for job displacement and a need for educational programmes
						that are recognised transnationally (IOE, 2017, p. 35).
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Securitization and Automation:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						The case for securitising automation is of particular importance in ensuring that the social and
						economic welfare of the global labour-force is preserved. If this is not securitised, then we
						face a monopoly from Silicon Valley companies and TNCs who can capitalise on the implementation
						of automation over human labour. Google and Facebook currently hire less people globally than
						General Motors did during the Great Depression (Naughton, 2019). Therefore, this analogises that
						automation poses an existential threat to the current global labour-force. Estimations towards
						job displacement as a consequence of automation ranges from 41% to 85% across developing
						countries, through reports by the Mckinsey Global Institute and the World Bank (See Table 1).

						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>
						In the United States, Frey and Osborne (2013, p. 41), estimate up to 47% of jobs are at
						high-risk of automation. In the United Kingdom, The Office for National Statistics estimates
						over 60% of jobs are within the medium- to high-risk category (ONS, 2019, p. 6). While in India,
						only 17% of their workforce has a regular wage (Calvão and Thara, 2019, p. 4). Huang and
						Sharif’s study on automation within Chinese factories sees their workforces drop between 67-85%
						(2017, p.65). Thus, it is a global phenomenon.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the labour-force is posed as the referent object, then it is in the interest of policy-makers
						to enact a performative speech act towards enacting extraordinary measures against the
						monopolisation of TNCs through increased taxation and diversifying job creation within these
						industries. Similar to the aforementioned ban on CFC use. One securitising measure that would
						require interstate, regional cooperation would be imposing regulatory measures on the taxation
						of ‘platform companies’, such as Google, who paid only 0.7% tax in one year, in regards to their
						global income (AFD, 2019, 1:31:30). Although this is a utopian ideal in the current global
						economy, it highlights the importance in securitising actors cooperating to pursue the
						extraordinary measures that enable the fiscal ability to provide a social safety net.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the extreme projections towards job displacement, this would be a necessary factor in
						ensuring that welfare systems, such as a universal basic income (UBI) or training program
						subsidies (such as Singapore’s SkillsFuture Credit program (MGI, 2019, p. 22)), are accessible
						to the global labour-force. Furthermore, internationally recognised training programmes, such as
						the ASEAN Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) (IOE, 2017, p. 35), could further secure the
						welfare of the individual if projections towards the increase of a ‘gig economy’ are realised
						(MGI, 2017b, p. 46). Both these aspects, UBI and MRA, are two measures that can be implemented
						to ensure that societal economic inequality is somewhat alleviated. Though, for this to be truly
						effective it would require strategic measures akin to the level of the Marshall Plan (MGI,
						2017b, p. 105). Table 2 summarises several strategies that adhere to this logic:

						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Automation and Gender:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						The role of women and men in the wake of automation is another key consideration towards
						focusing security policy to non-state areas. Access and incentives towards education is the
						greatest factor in providing increased gendered-equality within this context. Currently, the
						technology sector employs less than 20% of women, which follows a trend of women’s participation
						in STEM educational programmes, accounting for only 35% of global students enrolled in higher
						education (MGI, 2019, p. 25). An interesting caveat of incentivising employers to hire women
						within the technology sector, is that it also limits gender biases in the development of
						technology, particularly within the AI field (MGI, 2019, p. 35).
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, the presupposed cultural perspectives that relate to the roles of men and women,
						with the former presented as being the primary earner could lead to a reaffirmation of
						patriarchal models and a devolution of social progress. If automation does lead to huge job
						displacement, then it could cause a domino effect that pushes women out of the workforce (MGI,
						2019, p. 21). This would be due to the rise of low-skilled roles within sectors, such as
						healthcare, which are unlikely to be as susceptible to automation as other sectors and social
						biases favouring the employment of men over women (MGI, 2019, p. 18).
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						The effects of automation are unknown, as with any revolution of this nature. What we do know,
						is that previous industrial overhauls require the input and participation of governments and
						IGOs to alleviate the social consequences that are created. If automation is to be considered as
						successful, then actors must respond to the inequalities created by the monopolisation of
						technology companies. The most effective way to achieve this is to ensure that the security of
						the individual is ensured. Either through social safety nets, such as UBI, or by providing
						accessible educational programmes and an internationally accredited platform, such as with ASEAN
						MRA program. Furthermore, this requires the development of infrastructure to ensure that
						interstate cooperation is feasible and that global citizens have access to the technology that
						is tied to automation and the ‘gig economy’. Automation has global consequences and we need to
						look past the state for guidance on overcoming its issues.
