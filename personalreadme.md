#Universal Relations Media

This is the first Milestone Project for the 
Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.

In this project, we have been asked to utilise the 
skills that have been developed with HTML, CSS and 
a touch of JavaScript throughout the course. The use 
of JavaScript benefits us to create a more visually 
appealing page, while also allowing us to use as 
many of Bootstrap's functions as possible.

A further criteria for this project is aimed at writing
this page within the remits of Responsive Design. This 
will be adhered to and the visual impact of the pages 
will change depending on the media query that the 
device presents this content. By using Responsive Design 
principles, we can create a website that functions
efficiently and effectively across all devices.

This site, *Universal Relations Media*, is a faux 
blog site for articles that relate to politics and the 
arts across the globe.

The external user goal is to create a platform for user's 
to learn more about the topics covered within each article.
While highlighting the previous work conducted by the author.
Serving as a portfolio. 
To complement this learning experience, other articles that 
corroborate or could be considered as 'further reading' will 
be included on each post.

The site owner's goal is to utilise digital platforms to 
shape a personal portfolio of the author's academic research
and written work. This will improve their chance of employability
by highlighting the capabilities of the author across a 
number of academic disciplines: Political Philosophy and 
Full Stack Development. Indicative of this goal, is the 
choice to include a contact page for the author to promote 
collaboration and allow potential employers, or anyone that 
is interested in the site content, has the ability to reach 
out to the author.

Features that will be included are a landing page, two
blog pages - including real content written by the author, and a
contact page. This will showcase the abilities of the author
and provide insights into current affairs. One of the main
features of the site will be to include third party sources 
and their appropriate links. This allows the user to explore
the themes and content further, by their own volition. It
gives the user a choice towards how much time they would
like to dedicate to their own research and the capabilities
to do so. With this in mind, free content, partially-free
content (such as free monthly allocated articles by sources
such as New Statesman, The Atlantic, Foreign Affairs) and 
pay-to-view content will be balanced and included to create
a positive user experience, shaped by their own decisions.
