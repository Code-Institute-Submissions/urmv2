          <h3 class="text-center">How do issues become a focus of international governance?</h3>
          <br>
          <p class="card-text">
            This essay will focus on ‘Transnational antiglobalization protests’, a term coined by Kate O’Neil (2004), as representing how issues can become a focus of international governance. This will be analysed through two schools of thoughts in the school of international relations: Michel Foucault’s ideas on governmentality, and liberal institutionalism. Globalization will be considered as the product of neoliberal policy and practice that is synonymous with the end of the Cold War and technological developments that have occurred across the twentieth century; resulting in the ease of communication and transportation of people, goods and services across the globe. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            Foucauldian ideas towards governance shape the notion of a neoliberal discourse that has abetted the rise of protests against the neoliberal mentality that concurs with globalization. Whereas liberal institutions provide the mechanism for interaction and cooperation, while simultaneously exacerbating tensions between local, national and global actors. Thus, liberal institutionalism, and its imperative towards cooperation, can help to analyse the effect of institutions in leading to the act of protest and the cooperative measures that are taken to manage dissent by the actors who hold power.
          </p>
          <p>
            This essay is broken into three sections. Firstly, it explores Foucault’s ideas towards governmentality to convey the idea of a neoliberal order promoted by Western institutions as the dominant global discourse. Discursive by its provision of abided norms and values across the international system. Secondly, it explores how institutions have allowed for cooperation between a range of actors. The final section will explore transnational antiglobalization protests from the 1990s as a product of increasing international governance and the proliferation of influential institutions as promoting a neoliberal-discourse within the international realm. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Protests against the nature of globalization represent varying cooperative efforts from a range of actors: local community groups who act for the cause of the protest, the individuals who ‘police’ these protests, and the officials who represent the institutions that are protested against; national actors, which are the states themselves who create the policies, institutions and shape the interactions that lead to increasing globalization; and globally influential, supranational systems and institutions that serve as the technologies that allow for globalization, promote cooperation between actors and perpetuate the globally dominant discourse that is intertwined with neoliberalism. Therefore, transnational antiglobalization protests represent a focus towards international governance that is based on overcoming an issue inherent with neoliberal practices of globalization in the eyes of the individual – protestor - and providing a platform for cooperation between the actors – states -  that hold authority over the realms in which these protests take place, by policing and ensuring that the mentality of neoliberal-hegemony is preserved within the international system vis-a-vis institutions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Foucault and Governmentality:</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
          Governmentality is the inculcation of norms or practices that are taken for granted as an aspect of daily life and are actualized through the actions and thoughts of its subject within a society (Open University, 2020a). The ‘conduct of conduct’: the formation of a framework of ideas and practices that subserviently mould one’s actions and beliefs. This idea was presented by Michel Foucault during his lectures, ‘The Birth of Bio-politics’, at the College de France between 1978-79 (Lemke, 2001, pp. 190-91). It was based upon his theory that we are living within periods of history that are attributed to the way power is exerted over a population: ‘statecraft’ (the logic that constitutes political power) shifted from sovereign power – retention of territorial control through the monopoly of violence – to governmental power; the control or governance over the residing population – their wellbeing, their economic ability and the values that are inherent within the society (Corry, 2014a, pp. 95-96). 
          </p>
            <p>
            The apparatus of governmentality transferred rights and laws as its primary mechanism to a market-based focus on ‘interest, investment and competition’ (Read, 2009, p. 28). Consequently, the individual as a subject shifted from homo juridicus, a subject bound to the legal framework of the state, to homo economicus, a subject bound to the state through their economic exchanges (Read, 2009, pp. 28-9).  Thus, governors shaped the mentality of its subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
            For Foucault, this historical shift was attached to the advent of liberalism in the eighteenth century. Liberal governance, and its malleable nature, was presented as the categorization and specification of objects: the discursive field of solutions vs problems and its specifications for how governance should be represented and enacted (Lemke, 2001, p. 191). The contemporary historical context of this liberalism, followed ideas of eighteenth-century economists, such as Adam Smith and Francois Quesnay, and further developed liberalism as a market-based philosophy that promoted peace via the free market (Harcourt, 2009, p. 5).
            </p>
            <p>
            Following the liberal principles of individual agency and the free market, the market was ‘naturalised’ – it was naturally autonomous in achieving the greatest level of efficiency in the production and distribution of goods and services, and, therefore, state interaction would undermine the potential of the market (Read, 2009, p. 27). This creates a paradox, how can a state govern its subjects under the liberal rationale of diminished state interaction to preserve market potential? By shaping mentalities and utilising technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
            As noted by Olaf Corry, mentalities are ‘bodies of knowledge’ that are considered as true by its subjects, and technologies are the tools that are implemented to perpetuate this mentality (2014a, p. 98). Mentalities take the form of assumed truths and the institutions that authenticate these assumptions. Technologies are devices that corroborate the mentality put forward, which can be anything from the physical, a jail cell that incarcerates the mentality-dissident, to statistics, such as the human development index or gross domestic product – it is any tool that leads to the manifestation of the desired mentality. The aforementioned paradoxical logic of liberalism necessitated an evolution into a neoliberal mentality; where homo economicus is bound to the state through their exchanges, the neoliberal-state must develop this binding to facilitate autonomous, individual competition within the market (Read, 2009, p. 28). 
            </p>
            <p>
            This imperative can only be achieved if the state creates the conditions in which competition can thrive, such as creating laws that prohibit monopolization (Lemke, 2001, p. 194). Thus, homo economicus, under neoliberal governmentality, rationalise all aspects of their life through an economic lens: ‘Everything for which human beings attempt to realize their ends… can be understood “economically” according to a particular calculation of cost for benefit’ (Read, 2009, p. 28). The purpose of homo economicus is to increase its own human capital through technologies – every act; the clothes they choose to wear, the skills they develop and even their own biological makeup, contribute to their human capital. Foucault summarises this as “Homo economicus is an entrepreneur, an entrepreneur of himself” (Foucault in Read, 2009, p. 28). 
            </p>
            <p>
            These ideas represent neoliberal governmentality on the state level, for this to be projected onto the realm of international governance it becomes necessary to focus on the international institutions that help to foster a competitive global market and promote a neoliberal discourse.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Liberal Institutionalism:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
            Liberal institutionalism is based on the idea that in the 1970s states had multiple economic interests, the best method of achieving these economic ends, was through cooperation between states via institutions and when absolute gains are achieved by the actors involved – any gain is better than none (Open University, 2020b). This is in opposition to realist logic that presumes that states serve as the only actor in the anarchic international system and are situated in a constant balance of power, solely motivated by relative gains: the attainable gains of one state can only be considered a gain if it fares better off than the state with whom it is cooperating or interacting with (Mearsheimer, 1994, p. 12). 
            </p>
            <p>
            Although, liberal institutionalism and realism share some key assumptions about the international system, this can be seen by the first two principles of liberal institutionalism: foremost, the state is considered as the key actor for representing a society – ‘non-state actors are subordinate’; secondly, it accepts the structural notion of anarchy, but views the existence of institutions as representative of achievable cooperation between states by reinforcing norms and providing sanctions for dissenters; thirdly, processes of integration are increasingly regional and global, as can be seen by institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organisation (WHO); and finally, states are motivated to cooperate under the basis of absolute gains – cooperation is beneficial in the terms of gaining anything from an interaction between actors (Dunne, 1997, p. 159).
            </p>
            <p>
            One key aspect of institutions attending to the issues of global governance is that of information sharing and how this contributes to the development of shared norms and values within the international system. The UN is viewed as the closest institution to achieving global governance by the precedent it sets towards issues such as human rights, peace-keeping and promoting sustainable development for under-developed states (Taylor, 1997, pp.281-83). Thus, the dissemination of information, and the values they represent, are largely attributable to the Americanisation of institutions and the transparency of liberal democracies as opposed to authoritarian regimes (Keohane, 1998, p. 93). 
            </p>
            <p>
            This leads to the notion that there is a level of governmentality across the international realm that has been perpetuated by liberal institutions, influencing a state’s own development and their relations with other states (Corry, 2014b, p. 154). This governmentality can be considered as a product of the neoliberal-discourse since the 1990s, post-Cold War period, as an embodiment of this discourse, liberal institutions have faced a rise of protests against their norms, values and practices from the globally spanning homo economicus.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Transnational Anti-Globalisation Protests:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
            Transnational antiglobalisation protests from the 1990s represent a growing concern towards neoliberalism by the subjects who shape states economic interactions: homo economicus (O’Neill, 2004, p. 237). The ‘Battle of Seattle’, a protest against the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1999, is regarded as one of the key moments in empowering homo economicus against the neoliberal-discourse that is synonymous with liberal institutions (Smith, 2000, p. 1). Empowered by what Carl Death defines as ‘counter-conduct’, a utilisation of Foucauldian terms (Death, 2010, p. 236). Counter-conduct is the direct action of protesting against the governmentality that conducts our, or the subject’s, mentality. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Through this very act, the discursive field of neoliberalism is paradoxically representative by signs of dissent from certain groups of its subjects which helps to reinforce the discourse that is being countered by the consummation of action by the dissenters as highlighting that the zone of protest are representative of where power is held (Death, 2010, p. 243). Through the notion that this is the actualised mentality and institutions are the key technologies used to implement this governmentality on a transnational scale. Therefore, by recognition of a neoliberal governmentality that transcends national borders, via the mechanisms of liberal institutions and through counter-conduct enacted by its subjects, this form of governmentality is solidified through pragmaticism as the way things are (Death, 2010, pp. 244-45). 
            </p>
            <p>
            Thus, on a global scale, the dissenting homo economicus weighed up the cost – imprisonment, a victim of ‘policing’ , or financial hardship – of counter-conduct against these institutions for their global counterparts; by reiterating the benefits of decreasing inequality between the subjects who live under a neoliberal governmentality, decreasing influence and power of the corporations that cooperate with these institutions, and denouncing the principles institutions promote for states economic interactions (Sandberg, 2006, pp. 215-16).
            </p>
            <p>
            Similarly, the actors who embody these institutions also apply a cost-benefit analysis through use of violence or suppression against the dissenters and whether it undermines or empowers the neoliberal governmentality – such as the death of a protestor in Genoa in 2001 (O’Neill, 2004, p. 245). The greatest concern for both parties was amassing the cooperation needed to act against, or provide suppression for the preservation of, this neoliberal-governmentality (O’Neill, 2004, p. 247). To consider this through Game Theory, both are locked into a dangerous, game of ‘chicken’: if both swerve, then both lose any legitimacy for their cause; if one swerves, the other party retains dominance of power and represents the right way; and if neither swerve it could lead to civil disarray, nationally and internationally (Oye, 1985, p. 8). 
            </p>
            <p>
            Between 1996 and 2001 there were 47 protests against liberal institutions (Lichbach, 2002, pp. 10-11). Ranging from ten participants in May 1998 in Kiev, against the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to over 100,000 global participants in September 1999 in the name of Seattle against the WTO. The increase of counter-conduct of this nature prompted states and institutions to share information to quell the threat of these protests, either by preventative means or direct offense - particularly under the auspice of ‘Anti-Terror’ policies after September 2001 (O’Neill, 2004, p. 246). 
            </p>
            <p>
            Therefore, the sharing of information between states, vis-à-vis institutions, has, to an extent, increased cooperation in the international system (Keohane, 1998, p. 85). Although the increasing use of violence and deprivation of liberty tactics – preventative measures - sets a standard for those that wish to dissent from the discursive field of neoliberalism and the tactics that are permissible in quelling these threats, itself moulding a duality of logic for violence between the ‘police’ and the protestors themselves – violence breeds violence (Death, 2010, pp. 244-45).
            </p>
            <p>
            A final characteristic of institutions leading to or preventing global governance is that of the vast increase of non-state actors, their varying imperatives and the rules or norms they present (Keohane, 1995, p. 48). If these rules or norms overlap, cooperation becomes easier, but this is in the context of Westernised liberal institutions, other institutions that coincide with the rise of power in the Global South may prohibit international governance (Mearsheimer, 1995, p. 6), due to the variances in their governmentality apparatuses (Corry, 2014a, p. 117). This is also true for activist groups, particularly through their use or non-use of violent tactics (O’Neill, 2004, p. 243). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
            The growth of non-state actors is likely to continue as technological developments that inhibit globalization continue to evolve. Itself increasing the likelihood of issues that lead to Transnational antiglobalization protests within the minds of homo economicus. The contemporary deciding factor for global governance is likely to be based on the triarchy between the Western-liberal model, an Asiatic model or one that is wholly universal for the wellbeing of all of global society. The latter model is utopian, at best, leaving it to the result of a shifting balance of power between ‘the West and the Rest’ to determine the likelihood of global governance.
